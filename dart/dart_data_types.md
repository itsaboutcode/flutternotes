# Data Types

## Void
- A special type that indicates a value thatâ€™s never used. 

## var
- A way to declare a variable without specifying its type.


## Characters and Strings

- In flutter, string is a data type which can hold both a single character, array of characters or a literal string. That's why you can enclose it in single and double quotes.


```js
String char = "H";
var string = 'Hello WOrld';
```

You can concatenate two strings with + operator.

```js
var hello = 'Hi' + "!";
assert(hello == 'Hi!');
```
