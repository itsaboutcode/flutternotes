# Flutter

- Flutter is **Google's UI toolkit** for building beautiful, **natively compiled applications** for mobile, web, and desktop from a single codebase.

## Introduction to widgets

- The central idea is that you build your UI out of widgets. 
- Widgets describe what their **view should look like** given their **current configuration and state**. 


- `Widget` is a component user see on the screen.
- In flutter, almost every object `is a` instance of `Widget` class in one way or the other.
- In flutter, views are created by compsition, one object is composed of many different smaller object. It created a `has a` relationship.

- A chain of things connected by the **has a** relationship is called a **composition hierarchy**.
- The chain of things connected by the **is a** relationship is called the **inheritance hierarchy**.
