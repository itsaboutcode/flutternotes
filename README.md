## Ahead-of-time (AOT) compiler

- These compilers translate the whole app code in machine language so that OS don't have to do any translation while running the program.
- These program feel fast because OS don't have to do any translation.


## Just-in-time (JIT) compiler

- JIT complier just translate `enough` code which is required to run the code on the machine.
- After that, it translate further when user proceed with the program e.g; when user press a button, application was suppose to open another screen. JIT compiler will only translate that code on demand.
